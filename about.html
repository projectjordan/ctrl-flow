                Ctrl+Flow serves as a dedication to my overwhelming 
                love for all things that excite me; 
                <br>
                Whether that be
                the newest video games and the trends that follow them -
                the cutting-edge ideas in tech, 
                the thrill-seeking stunts I wish I had the guts to 
                pull off,
                or the music that I love to listen to.  
                <br>
                I started
                my journey in web design and programming in late 2023, 
                <br>
                and while I have much to learn, I want for this project to be something
                I can always look back on and cherish, as well as something that I can
                continuously improve upon, much like I plan on doing with myself. 
                <br>
                Thank you for joining me here and reading this - I hope you're around to see
                some of the cool things I want to build in the future! 
                <br>
                Stay Cool!
